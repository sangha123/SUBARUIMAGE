SUBARUIMAGE
===========

These are some python scripts that are used to download raw images of individual pointings from the SUBARU archive and combined them to produce a final image.
The result of these codes is the background optical image in page 25 of http://www.hep.anl.gov/sdeb/Talks/insightPBL.pdf.
